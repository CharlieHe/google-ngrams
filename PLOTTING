One way to plot data from a .tsv file created from the getngrams.py script is
to read the .tsv file into a pandas DataFrame object and call the .plot()
option on it.

For example, with a file called 'aluminum_steel-eng_2012-1800-2000-3.tsv', open
an IPython terminal in the directory with the file using the pylab inline
plotting backend (e.g. ipython --pylab=inline). Then you can do something like
the following to produce a plot of the data:

"""
from pandas import read_csv
df = read_csv('aluminum_steel-eng_2012-1800-2000-3.tsv', sep='\t', index_col=0)
df.plot()
"""
